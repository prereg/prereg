PREREG
======

A registration / ticket system for online ticket registration.  


Project status & release cycle
------------------------------

This is a hard fork of pretix, after the relicensing of pretix to 3-clause AGPL3.  
This version of prereg is based upon pretix licensed under the Apache License.  

This project will continue to develop the orignal software under the Apache License.
And this also means that all newer code released by pretix under the AGPL3+ license cannot be copied to this project.  
However we hope to deliver similar features.
